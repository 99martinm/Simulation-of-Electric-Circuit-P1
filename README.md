# Simulation-of-Electric-Circuit-P1

This repository is containing scripts used in the prossing of data realting to the P1-Project 
form Mathematics-Technology Group 5.215

The files realting to the first part of the project surrounding DC are:
- DC_VALUES.csv - Mesurements form the experiment
- DC.py - Script prossing the data and comparing it and the obtained model

The files realting to the second part of the project surrounding AC are:
- HpLpSim.py - Script for making plots of AC-indput in the Time domain
- low pass filter values.csv - Mesurements from the RC-Lowpass filter
- high pass filter values.csv - Mesurements from the RC-Highpass filter

Experiment:
- lowpass_bode_experiment.py - Plot of the experimental data for the lowpass filter
- highpass_filter_bode_experiment.py - Plot of the experimental data for the highpass filter

Mathmatical model:
- lowpass_filter_bode_math_model.py - Plot of the mathmatical model for the lowpass filter
- highpass_filter_bode_math_model.py - Plot of the mathmatical model for the highpass filter

Comparison: 
- comparison_plot_lowpass_filter.py - Plot of both the previous plots of the lowpass filter
- comparison_plot_highpass_filter.py - Plot of both the previous plots of the highpass filter

Deviation:
- Deviation_plot_lowpass.py - Plot of the diffrence between the plots of the lowpass filter
- Deviation_plot_highpass.py - Plot of the diffrence between the plots of the highpass filter

All of the Programs have been run in Spyder(Python 3.9) on Windows
